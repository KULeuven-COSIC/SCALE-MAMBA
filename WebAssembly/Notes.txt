WebAssembly/scale/examples

These examples are testing the `.asm` that is generated from small Rust
programs. They are very helpful in detecting bugs/changes in the
converter and do also help when writing new converter logic. I think we
should keep them.  The subdirectories hold the bc/asm/sch files



WebAssembly/scale/impl_generator

This is the compiler magic that generates all the operator overloads
from the `Documentation/instructions.rs`. Basically I was lazy and
didn't want to write all the `extern "C" fn addi...` and similar
implementations, and I was even lazier and didn't want to write `impl
Add for SecretI64` and similar. Anything that we can convert
automatically from the documentation saves us from having to hand-roll
lots of very similar code. If you want to see what happens, run `cargo
expand` in `WebAssembly/scale` and look at the output, it contains all
the generated code.


WebAssembly/src

That is the main web-assembly to scale-assembly converter, which also
handles `i64` since that is a builtin type that we can't override the
operators to call the assembly instructions.



WebAssembly/src/main.rs

Holds the wasm->scale converter


target directories:

Rust puts all its compilation artifacts in the `target` directory.
