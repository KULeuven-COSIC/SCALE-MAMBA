# Debug flags
#   SH_DEBUG = Share debugging (for development only)

#   DEBUGMEM = Turns on some memory debugging (really only meant for Rust pipeline)

# MAX_MOD = 7 should be OK for 128 bit based FHE operations

# Benchmark flags
#   BENCH_NETDATA = Enable benchmarking of network data
#   BENCH_MEMORY  = Enable benchmarking of memory 
#   BENCH_OFFLINE = Estimate how much offline data is consumed
#   		    - Note this counts how much stuff is needed by the
#   		      program and the daBit machine.
#   		    - The aBits/aANDs count counts all those used
#   		      by GC calls/sregint ops and GC. But not the
#   		      creation of the aANDs themselves
