/* This class gives an abstract base class which defines

 *
 * It is a virtual base class as anyone using the engine
 * need to re-write EVERY function in this class so as to
 * be able to catch all the read/write messages sent
 * by the MPC engine
 *
 * The derived classes could connect to stdin/stdout,
 * or could connect to files/streams, or could even
 * connect to sockets connecting to other services
 * on the internet.
 *
 * When compiling the system you may want/need to
 * change the precise IO class which is bound into the
 * system in Machine.h/Machine.cpp
